# Changelog

## Unreleased

### Changed

- Route terminal streams on Herdr 0.9.0 through the stable endpoint
  generation 1 protocol instead of the private direct-attach protocol: the
  browser terminal now renders the pane cropped from the server-rendered tab
  surface, input is classified into semantic key events, and scrollback goes
  through `pane.scroll`. Set `HERDR_GUI_DISABLE_ENDPOINT=1` to fall back to
  the legacy path. Panes sharing a tab still render at their layout size.

### Fixed

- Restore terminal-program OSC 52 clipboard writes on Herdr 0.9.0 endpoints,
  using its foreground recipient and Studio's recent-input filtering. Herdr
  does not identify the producing pane; delayed/background writes can reach
  the new foreground recipient. The legacy fallback remains unsupported.

- Preserve endpoint text and cursor alignment for Chinese and other Unicode
  graphemes, including halfwidth kana, without adding wide-character spacing.
- Restore cell-based clicks, drags and wheel input in endpoint terminal apps;
  retain browser selection/copy and history scrolling outside mouse-aware apps.
  Selected endpoint output pauses visually until selection clears.
- Clear stale terminal text on endpoint repaints, wait for the initial snapshot
  before attaching, and reject pending endpoint requests when disconnected.

## 0.5.3 - 2026-09-08

### Changed

- Add basic terminal compatibility with Herdr 0.9.0 (protocol 22), retaining
  legacy support and rejecting unknown protocols. Terminal-program OSC 52 and
  independent client navigation remain unsupported on 0.9.0.
- Refresh external layout changes and reconcile event subscription reconnects;
  explain grouped-workspace close refusals without silently closing the group.
- Count only conversation messages toward the 200-entry History window so
  tool-heavy turns no longer evict user messages, and fetch tool call/output
  payloads on demand instead of transmitting them with every refresh. Tool
  entries are now hidden by default and can be shown with the tool filter.
- Show each workspace's tab count as a subtle number in the workspace tree,
  and move the compact Inspector's back button into the file preview header.

### Fixed

- Keep the Inspector following workspace focus switches: a focus marker whose
  action completed without the workspace ever becoming focused no longer
  disables retargeting indefinitely.
- Stop duplicating IME text committed while switching input sources with
  candidates visible (e.g. leaving a Chinese IME mid-composition).
- Follow tab switches in the History view: re-pin the shown session to the
  newly active tab's agent (or the next available agent when the pinned pane
  closes) instead of showing a stale or missing session.
- Let the History wavebar pan independently: horizontal gestures scroll only
  the wavebar strip and its position indicator, so the timeline and wave no
  longer move or snap back until a bar is tapped or clicked.
- Keep the History wavebar smooth in long sessions: bars render once, the
  wave highlight updates without re-rendering the strip, and the strip only
  glides when the wave actually leaves its viewport.
- Follow the terminal theme for the terminal loading overlay and delay its
  appearance during pastes, so pasting no longer flashes a dark layer over a
  light terminal.

## 0.5.2 - 2026-09-06

### Added

- Add a website tutorial, History filters, and adjustable text size.
- Drag across the Files annotation gutter to comment on multiple lines.
- Drag workspaces in the sidebar to persistently reorder them.
- Reorder agent sessions by dragging them within the separate Agents panel.

### Changed

- Improve History refresh performance and tool output readability.
- Use a touch-friendly bottom sheet for the mobile application menu.

### Fixed

- Make `Cmd+W` close only the active pane in split tabs.
- Keep Diff scope labels on one line and mobile terminal shortcuts within view.
- Preserve History focus and view mode during refresh; correct Grok timestamps.
- Make terminal default colors follow the application theme while preserving
  explicit application colors, and keep terminal sizing free of a hidden
  scrollbar gutter.
- Upgrade xterm so IME preedit stays inside the viewport and anchors to the
  live cursor during TUI redraws.

## 0.5.1 - 2026-09-03

### Added

- Add pane keyboard shortcuts: `Cmd+Ctrl+Arrow` focuses the neighboring pane,
  `Cmd+D` splits the active pane right, and `Cmd+Shift+D` splits it down.
- Add a Herdr plugin manifest and launcher so Herdr Studio can be installed
  and managed with `herdr plugin install powerfooI/herdr-studio`, with start,
  restart, status, URL, version, and uninstall actions on Linux, macOS, and
  Windows. The plugin downloads a checksum-verified prebuilt release binary,
  so no source toolchain is needed.
- Add an interactive Herdr Studio popup pane (`herdr.studio` plugin `panel`
  entrypoint) showing service status, the login URL, and start, restart, and
  uninstall keys.

## 0.5.0 - 2026-09-02

### Added

- Add a responsive GitHub Pages landing page with a product tour, mobile
  previews, install guidance, social metadata, and automated deployment.
- Add configurable server log levels with concise, timestamped default output,
  deduplicated retry failures and recovery summaries, and debug-only request,
  event, terminal, and successful auto-sync diagnostics.
- Add inline review annotations for diff lines, source lines, and rendered
  Markdown selections. A shared review panel edits and orders comments,
  preserves drafts per checkout, copies compiled feedback, or pre-fills an
  agent pane without submitting it. Content anchors follow moved lines when
  possible and remain available with a stale marker when source text changes.
- Add Git file actions to the Changes panel: right-click, long-press, or the
  keyboard context-menu key on a working-tree file opens a menu with Open
  file, Copy relative/absolute path, and status-matched Git actions (stage,
  unstage, mark resolved, discard unstaged changes, delete untracked file).
  A new "More Git actions" menu beside Refresh offers repository-wide Stage
  All, Unstage All, Discard All Unstaged, and Delete All Untracked with
  affected-file counts. Destructive actions ask for confirmation, and the
  server re-verifies each file's status and content fingerprint before
  mutating so stale menus can't destroy newer work.
- Dim Git-ignored files in the Files explorer.

### Changed

- Pressing Esc no longer collapses or closes the Inspector now that it docks
  beside the content instead of covering it; use the header buttons to
  expand, restore, or close it.
- Simplify the Files explorer rows to show only the file or folder name; the
  full path remains available as a hover tooltip.

### Fixed

- Parse C-style quoted Git paths (spaces, quotes, backslashes) in Changes
  summaries so files with such names show and diff correctly.

## 0.4.12 - 2026-09-01

### Fixed

- Fix text selection in file and session previews: Cmd/Ctrl+A now selects only
  the preview content instead of the whole page (line numbers included), and
  copying a selection always yields the exact document text, including lines
  outside the rendered viewport. A Copy button in the file preview header
  copies the entire file content.

## 0.4.11 - 2026-08-31

### Added

- Add a mobile terminal composer: a pen toggle opens a bottom-docked panel
  that also hosts the configurable terminal shortcut keys alongside an editor
  where IME, dictation, selection editing, and multiline paste work natively.
  Insert places the draft in the terminal without executing; Send adds
  exactly one Enter. Drafts stay in memory per connection and pane and are
  never persisted.
- Add image support to the mobile composer: pasted clipboard images and the
  image picker upload once through the existing endpoint and insert the
  returned path at the caret; the path reaches the terminal only on Insert or
  Send.
- Warn before closing a pane, tab, or workspace that still holds an unsent
  composer draft; confirming discards the draft.

## 0.4.10 - 2026-08-29

### Added

- Add a mobile tab switcher: a Tabs button with a count badge in the mobile
  nav opens a bottom sheet for creating, switching, and closing tabs when the
  tab strip is hidden.
- Preview PDFs and workspace-local Markdown images in File Explorer.
- Show the agent's current directory next to agents in the workspace tree.

### Changed

- Present the selected file name as the preview heading and move Changes into a
  separate header toggle.
- Move per-file actions in File Explorer into a single "..." menu anchored to
  the row.
- Remove the worktree marker icon and corner glyph from workspace tree rows;
  indentation alone conveys the hierarchy.
- Spell out the linked-worktree badge as "Worktree" in the inspector.
- Move the agent status icon in tabs before the tab name.

## 0.4.9 - 2026-08-28

### Changed

- Rebrand the app as **Herdr Studio**: page title, brand header, in-app copy,
  and documentation.
- Disable pinch and double-tap zoom on phones so the terminal layout stays
  fixed.
- Hide floating action buttons while the on-screen keyboard is open.

### Fixed

- Keep desktop file downloads as direct downloads instead of opening the
  system share sheet (e.g. macOS Safari).
- Keep the mobile terminal flush with the on-screen keyboard so no black
  strip appears above it, including with third-party iOS keyboards.

## 0.4.8 - 2026-08-27

  activity, including commits and untracked files.
